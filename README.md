# Inheritance in Python

## Introduction
Inheritance is an important concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships between classes.

## Types of Inheritance
- **Single Inheritance**  
- **Multiple Inheritance**  
- **Multilevel Inheritance**  
- **Hierarchical Inheritance**  
- **Hybrid Inheritance**  

## Topics to Learn
- Understanding the `super()` function  
- Overriding methods in derived classes  
- Implementing different types of inheritance  
- Exploring method resolution order (MRO)  
- Handling multiple base classes
